As an example, it makes a difference if one knows the algorithm family (e.g. AES) or the specific variant or instantiation (e.g. AES-128-GCM). This is because the security level and the algorithm primitive (authenticated encryption) are only defined by the definition of the algorithm variant. The presence of a weak cryptographic algorithm like SHA1 vs. HMAC-SHA1 also makes a difference.",
